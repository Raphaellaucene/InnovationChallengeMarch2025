# ROI Calculator

This project is a simple ROI (Return on Investment) calculator designed to help leaders prepare for change initiatives by providing predictive insights, actionable recommendations, visualizations, and reports.

## Objectives and Goals

The primary objective of this project is to provide a tool that helps leaders make informed decisions about change initiatives by predicting the potential return on investment. The goals include:
- Offering predictive insights to guide decision-making.
- Providing actionable recommendations to maximize ROI.
- Delivering visualizations and reports to communicate findings effectively.

## Components

The ROI Calculator consists of the following components:
- **Input Form**: Collects data from users, including project budget, number of employees impacted, and project duration.
- **Calculation Engine**: Processes the input data to compute potential ROI, considering various factors such as financial risks and productivity gains.
- **Visualization Module**: Generates charts and graphs to visually represent the ROI and related insights.
- **Reporting Module**: Creates detailed reports summarizing the findings and recommendations.

## Architecture

The architecture of the ROI Calculator is designed to be modular and scalable:
- **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface for data input and result visualization.
- **Backend**: Implemented with a server-side language (e.g., Python, Node.js) to handle data processing and calculations.
- **Database**: Stores historical data and user inputs for analysis and reporting purposes.
- **API**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless data flow and processing.
